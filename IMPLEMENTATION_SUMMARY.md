## Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation of the seller application and dashboard access workflow for the Aakaari reseller platform.

## Implementation Date
October 20, 2025

## Problem Statement
Fix the complete seller application and dashboard access workflow with proper status handling, application submission, and admin management features.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Dashboard Access Control (dashboard.php)
**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Changes Made**:
- Completely rewrote access control logic (lines 28-78)
- Now checks application status in priority order:
  1. No application submitted → Redirect to become-a-seller
  2. Pending application → Show pending review message
  3. Rejected application → Show rejection message with reason
  4. Suspended application → Show suspension message
  5. Approved application → Show dashboard

**Features**:
- Custom styled status pages for each state
- Rejection messages display admin-provided reasons
- All status pages include relevant actions (contact support, logout)
- Clean, user-friendly UI with icons and helpful information

### 2. Login Flow Updates (login.php, inc/ajax-handlers.php)
**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Changes Made**:
- Added application status checking after successful login
- Updated both password and OTP login flows
- Proper redirection based on application status

**Flow**:
1. User logs in successfully
2. System queries user's application
3. Redirects based on status:
   - No application → `/become-a-reseller/`
   - Approved → `/dashboard/`
   - Other statuses → `/dashboard/` (shows appropriate message)

### 3. Application Status Taxonomy (inc/reseller-registration.php)
**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Changes Made**:
- Added 'suspended' term to `reseller_application_status` taxonomy
- Now supports four statuses: `pending`, `approved`, `rejected`, `suspended`

### 4. Application Submission (become-a-reseller.php, inc/reseller-application.php)
**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Changes Made**:
- Fixed `become-a-reseller.php` to not prematurely set `onboarding_status = 'completed'`
- Updated `reseller-application.php` to:
  - Set proper `pending` taxonomy status
  - Add all required metadata fields
  - Track submission date and IP address
- Removed incorrect onboarding status update triggered on page load

**Metadata Saved**:
- `reseller_name`

- `submitDate`

### 5. Admin Dashboard - Real Data (admindashboard.php)
**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced all mock data with real WordPress data
- Real statistics calculation:
  - Total resellers from WordPress users
  - Active resellers count
  - Pending applications count
  - Total orders from WooCommerce
  - Today's orders
  - Total revenue
  - Monthly revenue
- Real user management:
  - Queries actual users with 'reseller' role
  - Shows real user data: name, email, phone, orders, revenue
  - Displays status based on application status
- Applications query fetches all submitted applications

1. `aakaari_approve_application()` - AJAX handler for approval
2. `aakaari_reject_application()` - AJAX handler for rejection
3. `aakaari_suspend_reseller()` - NEW: Suspend reseller accounts
4. `aakaari_activate_reseller()` - NEW: Activate/reactivate accounts

**Features**:
